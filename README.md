## Hi, I'm Aniket Jadhav 👋

**Staff-leaning Frontend & AI Platform Engineer**  
Bangkok, Thailand

### 🚀 About Me

I build high-performance web platforms and AI-native product experiences with a strong focus on **architecture, security, and real-world impact**.

Currently working on AI and cloud platforms, where I design and ship:

- Multimodal AI interfaces (RAG, agents, streaming)
- Secure authentication systems (OAuth2, PKCE, BFF)
- High-performance React/Next.js applications
- Scalable SaaS and cloud dashboards

I enjoy working at the intersection of **product, platform, and developer experience**, and I’m particularly interested in how AI reshapes modern web applications.

---

### 🧠 How I Think

- **Platform over features** — I prefer building systems that scale across teams.
- **Measure what matters** — performance, reliability, and business impact first.
- **Security is a product feature**, not an afterthought.
- **Simple systems scale better** than clever ones.
- Always optimizing for **developer experience + user experience together**.
