### About Me 🚀
Hi, I'm <b>Aniket Jadhav</b>. I have been working as a Front-End Developer since 2016 and currently as a Software engineer at [Nirmata](https://nirmata.com/). I am very passionate and curious about the every stack and process in Software development. I think Developing is the best medicine when combined with the Laughter and Passion 💙.

In my free I like to play and watch ~soccer~ football ⚽, to watch and learn about Geo-politics and Science related stuff and to brag about how great my jokes are  (that know one laugh at them except myself 😅) and logic behind them 😏.

Also like to day dream about solving a problem that will change millions of lives (not just only human lives) 👼.

### Technologies that I love (because I use them :P)
